# Security

- Secrets (passwords, keys, tokens, `.env`, local configs) — not in code, commits, or context.
- Do not edit production directly; destructive operations on production data — only
  with explicit confirmation and a dry run on a copy.
- Before a risky change — show a diff and rollback plan, ask for confirmation.
- Full rules — in `../../AGENTS.md`.
